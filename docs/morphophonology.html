  <p>This is an analysis of the morphophonology of Latin verbs. Based on research by Morris Halle, David Embick, and Andrea Calabrese, including <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ling_a_00313">“Aspects of the Morphophonology of the Verb in Latin and in German and English”</a> and other unpublished results.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Latin has the usual five vowels /a e i o u/, with phonemic length contrasts for each, typically indicated with macrons /ā ē ī ō ū/. Latin also has three diphthongs /ae oe ui/, but those are not relevant here. Following Halle’s analysis, we posit an underlying sixth vowel /ɨ/ that is deleted in some contexts (namely, before vowels) and otherwise pronounced as /i/.</p>
  <p>What follows is a breakdown of each vowel sound into its features. Each vowel can, of course, be long [+long] or short [-long]; this is not represented in the table below. The two back vowels /o u/ are round, so the feature [±round] is left out in this analysis. The two vowels /a ɨ/ are considered central: that is, neither front nor back, and they group together this way for the purposes of prevocalic deletion.</p>

  <p>Latin verbs follow strict patterns of inflection. Each pattern is called a conjugation, typically analyzed in one of four conjugations (I, II, III, IV), with the fifth (III(i)) being a variant of the existing ones (namely III and IV). Each conjugation is usually associated with a theme vowel, as detailed below, that features prominently in the present tense, and also influences other parts of the conjugations.</p>
  <p>In addition to present stem and their conjugation, in order to conjugate a Latin verb properly one needs to know its perfect and supine stem. Often these are derived from the present stem, using patterns based on the conjugation, but sometimes they need to be memorized. Irregularities in conjugation based on the perfect stem are rare, and the supine stem is almost completely regular, if it exists.</p>
  <p>The vast majority of verbs belong to one of these regular conjugations, only a handful of verbs are considered irregular, and even then, most forms are usually regular.</p>

  <p>Spell-out rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> ASP[perf] ⟶ /v/ (/u/), /s/, /∅/ + /ɨ/
      <p>Note: selected by verb root via vocabulary insertion.</p>
    <li> T[pres] ⟶ /∅/ (T node deleted)
    <li> T[past] ⟶ /s/+/∅/ in env. ASP[perf]__M[subj]
      <p>Note: NOT rhotacised.</p>
    <li> T[past] ⟶ /∅/ in env. __M[subj]
      <p>Note: not sure if this is null, or if M[subj] is null.</p>
    <li> T[past] ⟶ /s/+/ā/ in env. ASP[perf]__
      <p>Note: rhotacised.</p>
    <li> T[past] ⟶ /b/+/ā/ in env. v+TH[-front]__
    <li> T[past] ⟶ /ēb/+/ā/ in env. v+TH[+front]__
    <li> T[fut] ⟶ /s/+/ɨ/ in env. ASP[perf]__
      <p>Note: rhotacised.</p>
    <li> T[fut] ⟶ /b/+/ɨ/ in env. v+TH[-front]__
    <li> T[fut] ⟶ /∅/+/ē/ in env. v+TH[+front]__

    <li> M[subj] ⟶ /s/ + /ī/ in env. ASP[perf]__
      <p>Note: rhotacised.</p>
  </ol>
  <p>Rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Central-vowel deletion: Delete [-back, -front] in env. __V
      <p>This deletes /a/ and /ɨ/ for conjugations I and III.</p>
    <li> Rhotastic lowering: /ĭs/ ⟶ /ĕr/ in env. __V
      <p>This is rhotacism followed by lowering, in one rule. Lowering is properly /ĭ/ ⟶ /ĕ/ in env. __ rhotacised /s/, but a combined rule makes for a simpler encoding here.</p>
      <p>Note: note implemented yet.</p>
    <li> Rhotacism: /s/ ⟶ /r/ in env. V__V
      <p>This is a common sound change in the development of Latin phonology, and occurs in many contexts (c.f. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mos#Latin">mōs, mōris</a>). Notably for our analysis it allows us to posit that the infinitive /es-se/ is actually a regular form, being athematic.</p>
    <li> Shortening: V̄ ⟶ V̆ in env. __V
      <p>This takes care of vowel shortening for Conjugations I, II, and IV in various contexts, such as before /‑ō/ in the first-person forms.</p>
    <li> Shortening2: V̄ ⟶ V̆ in env. σ(__C[-strident])
      <p>This applies to vowels in a syllable with a nonstrident consonant in the coda. This takes care of vowel shortening for Conjugations I, II, and IV in the remaining contexts, such as in the third-person forms before /‑t/ and /‑nt/ and /‑n‑tur/ (but importantly not before the third-person passive /‑tur/, which starts a new syllable and still has a long vowel preceding it).</p>
      <p>Note: not implemented yet.</p>
    <li> High-vowel Fronting: [-front] ⟶ [+front] in env. [-back, +high]
      <p>Finally, as the last sound change, any remaining /ɨ/ are pronounced as /i/.</p>
  </ol>
